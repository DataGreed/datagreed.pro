Listenable is an audio-based learning platform that helps you learn new things while doing something else — commuting, 
running, doing housework, etc. With Listenable, you can build your learning playlist and listen to 5-minute audio 
lessons anytime, anywhere.

## My Role
***

I've joined Listenable as a Chief Technical Officer right after the initial UI design mockups were completed.

I was responsible for everything related to the technical side of the startup: gathering business requirements, 
leading the development team, designing project architecture, devops, etc.

Since we were bootstrapping without any outside funding, I did a lot of the stuff with my own hands including backend 
development, API design, Web App development, subscription and usage analytics, monitoring, deployment, load-testing, 
etc. (basically everything development-related except the development of the iOS App).
