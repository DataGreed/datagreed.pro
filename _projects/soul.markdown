Soul is a cloud platform which helps to create full-featured dating apps without writing a single line of server-side 
code. Developers get to focus on the most important – the product while Soul takes care of the complex infrastructure. 
Soul provides SDK for every popular platform: iOS, Android, Javascript; and provides HTTP REST API.
