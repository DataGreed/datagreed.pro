Drunk Shotgun is my love letter to hardcore old-school games. 
The perspective and art style are a homage to Crimsonland and other top-down shooters of that era, and the simple 
control scheme that lets you play with only one finger is a nod to Canabalt and Leap Day.

Jack, the game's protagonist leaves the bar at night and tries to go home, but quickly realises that he's
in no condition to do so – he's so drunk that he cannot stop spinning in circles. What's worse – he starts seeing
Goblins (or are they really there?) that don't really like him that much and start attacking him. Luckily, Jack has
his trusty shotgun that he can use to defend himself and move around the arena using recoil since he cannot walk.

The goal is simple: defeat 99 goblins and face the boss, the Legendary Blue Goblin to unlock an ancient weapon
that provides you with an ultimate challenge of your skills.

Tap the screen once to shoot. Hold the screen to engage bullet-time and release the screen to shoot while in it.

todo: add some promo-art here or some screenshots to break the page up or 
todo: add some gameplay videos with both weapons. Crossbow is badically the ultimate difficulty

## My Role
***

I had an idea for this game in October, 2019 after I discovered Archero. I really liked the simplistic control scheme,
but didn't like the fact that you only had control over the movements of the character, leaving aiming out of question,
so I thought of the ways to let player both shoot/aim and move with just one hand. 

The idea of a drunk guy emerged quite quickly and I created a prototype in three days in Unity using free assets.

Several days later I created an art specification and started looking for an artist.

Art was the only thing that I outsourced for this game, the sounds and music were licensed (some of the sounds I 
recorded myself). 

The game design, art direction, UI design, programming, animations and publishing were all done by me.

## Drunk Shotgun Postmortem

todo how long development took

### What went right
***

#### 1. 2D Lighting

todo Not going with it, using just alphas, huge 

#### 2. Art Style
todo - screenshots of design doc?
todo hard to find though, art station and such

#### 3. Look and Feel

todo Not going with it, using just alphas, huge; music, sound design (friend screenshot with shotgun sound in chat),
  
#### 4. Animating

todo: again. actually quite nice system for it in unity

#### 5. Code reuse
todo: screenshot from farm defence for fun
todo: from farm defense prototype
todo: first prototype was ready with my reused code some free assets in like three days or something
 

### What went wrong
***
#### 1. Animating
todo: some photos while animating 
lalal

#### 2. Playtesting

very limited to FFF
probably way to hard for some players

#### 3. Google Play Release

todo: rejected due to blood, fun fact on how it was accepted; screenshot of rejection?

#### 4. User acquisition
advertisment
targeting was awesome (doom) but ban

aso - did not find anything, no niche

#### 5. Monetization
very bad funnel and ad revenue; 
still not break even
