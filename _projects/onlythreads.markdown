OnlyThreads is a productivity extension for Slack that lets you transform some of your channels to knowledge base  
and never lose important decisions and answers. It also searches for answers automatically whenever someone asks 
about something that has already been answered or decided upon. 

## My Role
***

We've come up with an idea for OnlyThreads while working on nable and realizing that Slack is great for instant
communication but quickly becomes a mess if you want to use it for logging decisions and store knowledge that can
be accessed later.

I was responsible for everything related to the technical side of the project and product design: 
coming up with business requirements, designing the user flows, programming, devops, testing, screencasts, etc.


## How it works
