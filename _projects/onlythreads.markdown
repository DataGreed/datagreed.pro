Listenable is an audio-based learning platform that helps you learn new things while doing something else — commuting, 
running, doing housework, etc. With Listenable, you can build your learning playlist and listen to 5-minute audio 
lessons anytime, anywhere.

## My Role
***

We've come up with an idea for OnlyThreads while working on Listenable and realizing that Slack is great for instant
communication but quickly becomes a mess if you want to use it for logging decisions and store knowledge that can
be accessed later.

I was responsible for everything related to the technical side of the project and product design: 
coming up with business requirements, designing the user flows, programming, devops, testing, screencasts, etc.
