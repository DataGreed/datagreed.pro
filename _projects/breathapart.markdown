A top-down shooter where you’re a constantly running low on oxygen and can trade it for upgrades to have more chances 
defeating deadly enemies.

Submitted as an entry to [Ludum Dare #44](https://ldjam.com/events/ludum-dare/44/till-breath-do-us-part).
 
This is a compo project, meaning that it was created solo in 48 hours without using any previously created work.
Everything was done from scratch. Source code is [available on GitHub](https://github.com/DataGreed/LD44).


## Background 
***

Ludum Dare Compo is a kind of challenge I always wanted to try. Coming up with an 
idea of a game having only a theme and only 48 hours to create is totally from scratch without using any
assets or previously created work makes your brain work in interesting ways.

Theme of LD44 was "Your life is currency", so I took it quite literally, turning vital oxygen into a currency. 

Used tools:

- Unity as a game engine, 2d mode, project started from scratch
- Photoshop (made some pixel art from scratch, frame-by-frame animations and some floor textures from 
photo of household items)
- GarageBand (tried to synth some music – did not turn out well due to lack of time)
- AudaCity (fixed shot, hit and item pick up records, but did not really have time to add them to game, so the game 
has music, but no sound effects)
