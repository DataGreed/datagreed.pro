This tool lets you convert [Polyend Tracker](https://polyend.com/tracker/) projects and pattern files to MIDI, so you can compose music
on the Tracker and then easily port it over to your favourite DAW to continue working on it.

## Background
***
While working on my [musical](https://synapsoid.net/) [projects](https://obgonsverhu.ru) I found myself using 
[Polyend Tracker](https://polyend.com/tracker/) as a 
sequencer for external synthesizers a lot. Most of the time I've recorded the audio to 101 Music's BlueBox to bring it 
later into Ableton for final arrangement and mixing. At this stage I found 
[lack of MIDI export](https://help.polyend.com/624837-Is-the-Polyend-Tracker-able-to-importexport-MIDI-files) in 
Polyend Tracker very limiting and decided to reverse engineer the Tracker's pattern and project files to convert them to MIDI.

As a result I've created a Python Library that converts project and pattern file and a simple webtool that lets
you drop in a zipped Tracker project and get your arrangement and patterns in MIDI format.

Most of my thought process when reverse engineering is 
[documented](https://github.com/DataGreed/polyendtracker-midi-export/blob/main/reverse-engineering/session%201/session1-notes.md) 
in the GitHub repository.
