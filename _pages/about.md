Yes, that's my name. You can also know me as DataGreed. This nickname seems to be odd in the age of
megacorporatins trying to collect your data, but it's actually just a bad programming pun.

Over a decade I've spent a lot of time designing, developing mobile and web apps, APIs and other services, managing 
development teams and consulting startups.   

I've also designed and developed several games. 

Technology-wise, I prefer to work with Python and C#. I mostly work on macs – not because they are shiny and 
aesthetically pleasing – but because they feature the most stable and user-friendly version of BSD (also they are shiny 
and nice to look at). 

My hobbies include [music production](https://soundcloud.com/datagreed/tracks) and motorcycling.

If you want to hire me / make me an offer I won't be able to refuse / talk to me for whatever reason – 
drop me a line. My contact info is at the bottom of the page.
