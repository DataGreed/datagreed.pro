Yes, that's my name. You may also know me as DataGreed. This nickname seems to be odd in the age of
megacorporations trying to collect your data, but it's actually just a bad programming <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=datagrid" target="_blank">pun</a>.

Over a decade I've spent a lot of time designing & developing mobile and web apps, APIs and other services; managing 
development teams and consulting startups.   

I've also designed and developed <a href="https://datagreed.medium.com/how-i-wasted-4k-and-half-a-year-of-my-life-to-develop-a-game-that-earned-only-30-a94e0d59e554" target="_blank">several games</a>. 

Technology-wise, I prefer to work with Python and C#. I mostly work on macs – not because they are shiny and 
aesthetically pleasing – but because they feature the most stable and user-friendly version of BSD (also they are shiny 
and nice to look at). 

My hobbies include <a href="https://synapsoid.net" target="_blank">music</a> <a href="https://soundcloud.com/datagreed/tracks" target="_blank">production</a> and motorcycling.

If you would like to hire me or just talk to me for whatever reason – 
just [drop me a line](mailto:datagreed+fromprosite@gmail.com). My contact info is at the bottom of the page.
