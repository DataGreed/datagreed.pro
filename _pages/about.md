As you've proably already have guessed, my name is Alexey and my nickname, DataGreed, is quite a bad pun.

Over a decade I've spent a lot of time designing, developing and managing 
the development of mobile and web apps, APIs and other services.   

I've also designed and developed several games. 

Technology-wise, I mostly work with Python and C#. I do all my work on macs, not because they are shiny and 
aesthetically pleasing, but because they feature the most stable and user-friendly version of BSD (also they are shiny and nice 
to look at). 

My hobbies include [music production](https://soundcloud.com/datagreed/tracks) and motorcycling.

If you would like to hire me / make me an offer I would not be able to refuse / talk to me for whatever reason â€“ 
drop me a line. My contact info is at the bottom of the page.
